# sBlog.Net

In a very few words, sBlog.Net is a minimalistic blog engine. This project was heavily inspired by wordpress, though there are a lot more to 
come in the following days! You will be able to do all of the normal activities that you could do in a blog like adding a post or page, 
adding categories or tags, adding additional authors and many more. If I have to describe sBlog.Net in a single sentence, I would say,

"For the love of asp.net mvc and wordpress"

To get started, you just need an instance of Visual Studio 2010/2012 with ASP.Net MVC 4, MS SQL server (express 
should also be fine) and optionally IIS.
