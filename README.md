# sBlog.Net

In a very few words, sBlog.Net is a minimalistic blog engine. This project was heavily inspired by wordpress, though there are a lot more to 
come in the following days! You will be able to do all of the normal activities that you could do in a blog like adding a post or page, 
adding categories or tags, adding additional authors and many more. If I have to describe sBlog.Net in a single sentence, I would say,

“For the love of asp.net mvc and wordpress”!

To get started, refer to this short article! You just need an instance of Visual Studio 2010 with ASP.Net MVC 3, MS SQL server (express 
should also be fine) and optionally IIS.

Thanks for trying out sBlog.Net!

## Notes for sBlog.Net v2.0

```text
Notice: This version is currently under development and so is not fully tested.
```

Follow these steps to start experimenting with v2.0. This repository is for the development version of sBlog.Net.
For the released version go to https://github.com/karthik25/sblog.net/tree/sblog.net-v1.0-release.
To use this dev version, get the latest from github, extract the source. Then run the sBlog.Net.DB\v2.0\Update\sblog_02_01.sql 
by selecting your sBlog.Net database. Now, you are all set to use the new version of sBlog.Net! Once you launch, go to the 
settings page to play with the new disqus options!

In the near future, there will be a windows application to manage the database!
